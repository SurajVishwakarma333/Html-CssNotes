    <p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar
        system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as
        we know it could not exist here on our home planet.<br>

        <!-- examples of hr tags -->
        <hr style="width:50%;text-align:left;margin:left 50px">
        <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s
        volume would need <strong><em>1.3 million</em></strong> Earths to fill it . Its gravity holds <strong>the solar
            system</strong> together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in
        orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit
        (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged
        particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.
