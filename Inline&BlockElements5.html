<body>
    <!-- There are two display values: block and inline.

    1. Block Elements:-(match_parent)

    • A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space  (a margin) before and after the element.
    • A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and    right as far as it can).
    • Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

    2. Inline Elements:-(wrap_content)

    • An inline element does not start on a new line.
    • An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    • example : <span>    -->

    <!-- paragraph is block element it take whole line as a block(matchparent) -->
    <p>This is paragraph</p>
    <p>This is also a paragraph</p>

    <!-- span is inline element it does not take whole line as a block(wrapcontent) -->
    <span>This is span</span>
    <span>This is also a span</span>
