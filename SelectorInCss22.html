<!--  CSS Selectors :
        CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into three categories:

•   Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)

•   Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)

•   Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)


Simple and basic CSS selectors.

1. The CSS element Selector = The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
  Example :- Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

        p {
          text-align: center;
          color: red;
        }

2. The CSS id Selector =
        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
        To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
    Example:- The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 

        #para1 {
           text-align: center;
           color: red;
        }

3. The CSS class Selector =
        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
        To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
   Example:-  The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
              To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

        .center {
          text-align: center;
          color: red;
        }

4. The CSS class Selector =
          The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
          To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
    Example:- In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:  
    
    * {
        text-align: center;
        color: blue;
      }

5. The CSS Grouping Selector =
    The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
    Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

    Example:-
    h1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
      }
      
      h2 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
      }
      
      p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
      }

CSS Combinators

There are four different combinators in CSS:

•  descendant selector (space)
•  descendant selector (space)
•  child selector (>)
•  adjacent sibling selector (+)
•  general sibling selector (~)

1. Descendant Selector = 
    The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
    The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 

    Example:-
        div p {
          background-color: yellow;
        }


2. Child Selector (>) = 
    The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.
    The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:

    Example:-
        div > p {
          background-color: yellow;
        }        

3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) = 
    The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
    Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
    The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:

    Example
        div + p {
          background-color: yellow;
        }        

4. General Sibling Selector (~) =
    The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
    The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements: 

    Example
        div ~ p {
            background-color: yellow;
        }        

CSS Pseudo-classes

  A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

  For example, it can be used to:
    •  Style an element when a user mouses over it
    •  Style visited and unvisited links differently
    •  Style an element when it gets focus

The syntax of pseudo-classes:

      selector:pseudo-class {
        property: value;
      }

Anchor Pseudo-classes
Links can be displayed in different ways:

Example:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: red;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: green;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: hotpink;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
  color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Styling a link depending on state</h2>

<p><b><a href="default.asp" target="_blank">This is a link</a></b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective.</p>

</body>
</html>
